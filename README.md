You need to download the Viro app (free) onto your phone and it hosts your code for you, and takes care of camera functionality. The code runs from your computer on the local network. Viro gives you an endpoint from terminal which you put into the testbed area of the Viro app.

Portal takes a few minutes to appear because the 3D file takes a while to load. Then you can wlk through the portal into *another world*
